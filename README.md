# CS4375-Portfolio
Portfolio of my class work for CS 4347, Intro to Machine Learning.
## Overview to Machine Learning
For a quick introduction to machine learning and its capabilities, you can find an [overview here](Overview_to_Machine_Learning.pdf).
## C++ Data Exploration
The following [code](C++_Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp) replicates functions for finding mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation in C++. Here is an [overview](C++_Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.pdf).
## Linear Models
Here you can find my projects for [Regression](Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) and [Classification](Linear_Models/Classification.pdf) using the Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes linear models.
